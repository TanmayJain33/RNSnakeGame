# React Native Snake Game using react-native-game-engine

To make a game in React Native, we need a loop that updates the game while we play. This loop is optimized to run the game smoothly and for this purpose “react-native-game-engine” library is used.

React Native Game Engine includes components that allow us to add entities so that we can manipulate them. We use an array of system props for manipulating entities, detect touches, etc. for making a game.
